# Full-Stack
Application made to better understand Full Stack; how back-end communicated with both the front-end and the database.
It was made to showcase how React (front-end) connects with Spring Boot (back-end) and MySQL (database) through APIs.
The front-end shows the information on the database, with additional features like buttons that allows a user to Add, Edit, View, or Delete an entry directly from/to the database. React uses a local port (Http://localhost:5173) to connect to Spring Boot, which also uses a local port (Http://localhost:8080) to connect with MySQL, which uses local port (Http://localhost:3306). Spring Boot is connected to both React and MySQL.
