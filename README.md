The application made to better understand Full Stack; how back-end communicated with both the front-end and the database. It was made to showcase how React (front-end) connects with Spring Boot (back-end) and MySQL (database) through APIs.
The front-end allows user to enter First Name and Surname, when the Register button is clicked,it saves the details directly in the Database and displays the Full Name (First Name + Surname) in a text-area from the database. React uses a local port (Http://localhost:5173) to connect to Spring Boot, Spring Boot uses a local port (Http://localhost:8080) to connect with MySQL, MySQL uses local port (Http://localhost:3306).
Spring Boot is connected to both React and MySQL.
